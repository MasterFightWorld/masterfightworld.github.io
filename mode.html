        <p> Story mode is a mode where you follow a story line. You
          will start from minimal item to maximal item. You will gain alot of points from each level. You will learn things and then use things that you have learned to complete your levels. The more you learn the better you are.

        <a href="#" onclick="#">Continue</a>
        <p> Battle mode is a mode where you can join matches
            with other players or create your own matches. You 
            can select your own character, setting, e.t.c. You won't 
            gain a lot of points though, but Battle Mode is great to
            practice your skills. Battle Mode won't be educational.
